Free readers have the options of picking their queries.<br>-Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers;<br>-Making an air query (not addressing a reader in particular) is possible but doesn&#039;t guarantee an answer;<br>-Avoid making the same question over and over and/or to different readers in a short period of time, as this may lead to more confusion than clarification;<br>-Please refer to the Dream General threads for dream interpretation<br>-Provide feedback when applicable.

Marvel worked out a deal with Sony to bring Spider-Man to the MCU with critical and commercial success. Given that Fox’s last attempt at a Fantastic Four film was a huge box office bomb, they may have nothing to lose by teaming up with Marvel Studios.<br>&gt;There’s a lot of odd coincidences that could be used to support this theory.<br>&gt;Marvel has recently turned the Fantastic Four merchandise machine back on.<br>&gt;Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo said Marvel would be revealing some new footage and it would “blow people’s minds.”<br>&gt;The plot of Spider-Man Homecoming involved Tony Stark selling Stark Tower to unknown buyers. There’s another superhero team that operates out of a tower in NYC… The Fantastic Four.<br>&gt;Fox suddenly has the rights to produce X-Men TV series, when that was off limits before. Could they have traded film rights for The Fantastic Four?<br>What do you guys think we&#039;re actually dealing with here?",

        "com": "&gt;The question is not whether Tomahawk cruise missiles are useful but whether their usefulness is sufficient to justify the expenditure of ship’s volume, the concomitant increase in cost and the resulting decrease in number of submarines built? The volume and money dedicated to a submarine cruise missile capability could go to other ship’s functions and to building more subs. In other words, there is an opportunity cost associated with submarine launched cruise missiles.<br>&gt;Tomahawk missiles add size and cost to submarines. The size increase is 20% or so, depending on the specific sub class and version. The cost increase is harder to determine but one solid data point is the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) scheduled to be installed on the newest Virginias. The cost increase is estimated to be around $500M which is a 20% increase over the base cost of around $2.5B. By leaving out the VPM, we could build one extra Virginia class sub for every five subs built. Are the added Tomahawks worth losing one extra sub for every five built? To answer that, we need to recall the submarine’s mission(s).<br>&gt;In war, a submarine’s most important mission is anti-submarine warfare according to US Navy doctrine since the Cold War – I’m talking about attack subs, SSN’s, not ballistic missile submarines. The main job of our submarines is to eliminate the enemy’s submarines. A close second mission, but still second, is anti-surface warfare. Every mission after that is extraneous, in a sense. If, by eliminating all the other missions – Tomahawk capability, in this case – we could build an extra submarine for every five we now build, would this be worth the loss of 12-40 Tomahawks (we’re talking about Virginia class subs, now)? I suggest it would be and would be well worth it. <br>http://navy-matters.blogspot.com/2017/07/does-every-sub-need-tomahawks.html",

I have been toying with the idea that postmodern thought represents a recursion of premodern thinking, an attempt to retrace our steps and find a path back towards some alternative present; an essential component to postmodernism is the technology of history (printing, statistical modeling, etc. a kind of time travel) Is postmodern in some essential way conservative? Is there some literature which corresponds to this idea of mine? What do you guys think?",
